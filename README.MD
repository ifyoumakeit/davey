Using my brain to recreate React, Redux and CSS-in-JS from scratch/memory. I promise not to read any React or Redux docs or articles while creating this.

(AKA Recreating the wheel)

* [x] JSX
* [x] Inline Styles
* [x] Click Handlers
* [x] State management
* [x] Arrays / Multiple children
* [ ] Use Typescript
* [ ] CSS-in-JS
* [ ] VDOM

---

* [x] Bundling with Parcel
* [x] Transpilation with Babel

## Try it out
